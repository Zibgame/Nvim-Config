# ðŸ’¤  My Custom Nvim Config 

Welcome to my personalized Vim configuration! This setup is built on top of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) â€” a powerful and flexible Neovim config â€” but fully customized by me to boost my productivity and coding comfort. ðŸ’»âœ¨

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Config?

LazyVim gives a great base with smart defaults and plugin management.  
I tweaked it with my own plugins, key mappings, UI tweaks, and settings to fit how I work best.
